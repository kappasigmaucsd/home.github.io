                <p>Fellowship, Leadership, Scholarship, Service. These are the four pillars of Kappa Sigma.</p>

                <p>
                    The Pi-Psi chapter of Kappa Sigma was founded in 2009. Since then, the chapter has strived for greatness.
                    Kappa Sigma aims to give brothers the best undergraduate experience and prepare them from life after graduation.
                    From academic support for current members, networking with alumni, and preparation for graduate programs, Kappa Sigma creates excellence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kappa Sigma has 16000 active brothers in 305 chapters. We have raised over $12 million in the past four years.
                    Kappa Sigma truly is a brotherhood like no other. Number one, second to none.
